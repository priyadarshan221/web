        <h2>Common Wipro HR Interview Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Here are some common HR interview questions from Wipro along with example answers:</h3>
    <ul type="circle">
    <h4><li>Can you briefly tell us about yourself? Mention something that is not in your resume in 20 seconds</h4>
</li>
<p> <b>Example Answer:</b>My name is A and I have finished my graduation from X University. I wish to join the Z sector and I have tried my best to gain the necessary skills for this domain. I have 2 years of work experience (or no work experience) and have a deployed project based on Y. I have finished my schooling at X Higher Secondary School and my hobbies are reading books, swimming and playing the guitar. I also love playing and watching football.</p>
<p><b>To be Noted:</b> One should be careful about what one answers as the next questions will be based on this. For example, if you have mentioned a hobby, a skill or a project, you might be getting questions related to those. Thus, one must prepare what to say and be ready to answer questions associated with the things you mention. Also, since this is not a technical interview, one should not go into technical details and the HR interviewer generally does not want that.</p>
<li>What would be your strongest points?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example Answer:</b>My strongest points would be dedication, loyalty and enthusiasm. I also try to be humble, honest and as collaborative as possible. Cooperation is necessary and I love teamwork. My friends (or colleagues) have mentioned that I have a likeable personality and I believe that I have good communication skills. I also believe in goals and I am dedicated to achieving them. It is not great to compliment yourself, but I believe that I would be a good fit for the corporate culture and I have a positive attitude. I am also confident in my work and I maintain the integrity of my initial tasks.</p>
